# Introduction to ROS 2

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

ROS 2 is a complete redesign of the original ROS, built to address the needs of modern robotics applications, including multi-robot systems, real-time control, and commercial products. It is built on top of the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard, which provides a robust and scalable communication layer.

This chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of ROS 2, from its high-level architecture to its core communication patterns and development tools.
