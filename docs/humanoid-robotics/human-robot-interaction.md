# Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)

As humanoid robots become more prevalent in our daily lives, it is crucial that they can interact with humans in a safe, natural, and intuitive way. This is the domain of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).

## Communication

HRI involves both verbal and non-verbal communication.

-   **Natural Language**: Robots should be able to understand and respond to natural language commands.
-   **Gestures and Body Language**: Robots should be able to interpret human gestures and body language, and to generate their own non-verbal cues to communicate their intent.

## Safety

Safety is paramount in HRI. Humanoid robots must be designed to operate safely around humans, with redundant safety systems to prevent accidents.

## Shared Autonomy

Shared autonomy is a paradigm where the human and the robot collaborate to perform a task. The human provides high-level guidance, and the robot handles the low-level details of execution. This allows for a more flexible and robust interaction than either fully autonomous or fully teleoperated systems.
