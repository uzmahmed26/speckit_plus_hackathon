# Manipulation and Grasping

For a humanoid robot to be truly useful, it must be able to manipulate objects in its environment. This involves a combination of perception, planning, and control.

## Grasping

Grasping is the act of securely holding an object. It is a fundamental skill for manipulation.

-   **Form Closure**: A grasp has form closure if the object is geometrically constrained by the fingers, such that it cannot move.
-   **Force Closure**: A grasp has force closure if the robot can apply forces with its fingers to resist any external forces or torques on the object.

## Grasp Planning

Grasp planning is the process of determining the optimal finger positions and forces to achieve a stable grasp. This is a challenging problem that involves reasoning about the geometry of the object, the capabilities of the robot's hand, and the task to be performed.
