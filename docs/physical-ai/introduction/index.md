# Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI, often used interchangeably with Embodied AI, represents a paradigm shift in the field of artificial intelligence. It moves beyond the confines of digital computation and virtual environments to create intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. This is the domain of robots that walk, drones that fly, and autonomous cars that navigate our streets.

Unlike traditional AI, which often deals with static datasets and predefined rules, Physical AI operates in a dynamic, unstructured, and often unpredictable environment. It is a multidisciplinary field that draws upon computer science, robotics, neuroscience, and cognitive science to create truly intelligent agents that can learn and adapt through physical interaction.

This course will provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of Physical AI, the challenges of bridging the gap between the digital and physical worlds, and the technologies that are making it all possible.
