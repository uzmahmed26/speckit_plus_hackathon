# The Role of Large Language Models in Robotics

The recent advances in Large Language Models have had a transformative impact on the field of robotics. LLMs are not just powerful language models; they are also powerful reasoning engines that can be used to solve a wide range of robotics problems.

## LLMs as High-Level Planners

One of the most exciting applications of LLMs in robotics is as high-level planners. Given a complex, ambiguous command like "clean up the kitchen," an LLM can break it down into a sequence of concrete steps:

1.  Find all the dirty dishes.
2.  Pick up each dish and place it in the dishwasher.
3.  Find the sponge and wipe down the counters.
4.  Put the sponge back in the sink.

## LLMs for Dexterous Manipulation

LLMs can also be used to generate policies for dexterous manipulation tasks, such as grasping and assembling objects. By providing the LLM with a description of the object and the desired goal, it can generate a sequence of motor commands to achieve the task.

## LLMs for Human-Robot Interaction

LLMs are also a powerful tool for improving human-robot interaction. By using an LLM to power a robot's conversational abilities, we can create robots that can understand and respond to natural language in a more human-like way.
