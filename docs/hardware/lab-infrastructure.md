# Lab Infrastructure

In addition to the robot itself, you will need a well-equipped lab space to support your robotics development.

-   **Workspace**: A dedicated workspace with a large table or workbench.
-   **Power**: Plenty of power outlets for your workstation, robot, and other equipment.
-   **Tools**: A good set of basic hand tools (screwdrivers, wrenches, etc.) and electronics tools (soldering iron, multimeter, etc.).
-   **Prototyping Equipment**: A 3D printer is an invaluable tool for creating custom parts for your robot.
-   **Safety Equipment**: Safety glasses are a must when working with tools and robots. A fire extinguisher is also a good idea.
