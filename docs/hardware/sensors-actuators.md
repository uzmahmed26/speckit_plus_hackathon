# Sensors and Actuators

## Sensors: The Senses of the Robot

Sensors are the "eyes, ears, and skin" of a robot, allowing it to perceive its environment and its own internal state.

-   **Vision (Cameras)**: Cameras are one of the most versatile sensors in robotics, providing rich information about the world.
-   **Depth (LiDAR, Depth Cameras)**: LiDAR and depth cameras provide 3D information about the environment, which is essential for navigation and obstacle avoidance.
-   **Inertia (IMUs)**: Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are used to measure the robot's orientation and motion.
-   **Position (GPS, Encoders)**: GPS is used for outdoor navigation, while encoders are used to measure the position of the robot's joints.
-   **Force and Touch (Tactile Sensors)**: Tactile sensors allow a robot to "feel" its environment, which is crucial for manipulation and grasping.

## Actuators: The Muscles of the Robot

Actuators are the "muscles" of a robot, converting energy into physical motion.

-   **Electric Motors**: The most common type of actuator in robotics. This includes DC motors, servo motors, and stepper motors.
-   **Hydraulic and Pneumatic Actuators**: Used in applications that require high force or speed.
