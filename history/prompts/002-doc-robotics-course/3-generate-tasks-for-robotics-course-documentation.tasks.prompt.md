## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

The `tasks.md` file for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course Documentation" has been generated.

**Tasks File**: `specs/002-doc-robotics-course/tasks.md`

**Summary**:
- Total Tasks: 19
- Setup Tasks: 8
- Foundational Tasks: 1
- User Story Tasks: 7 (1 per topic)
- Polish Tasks: 3
- Parallel opportunities have been identified for the setup phase and the user story (content generation) phases.
- The suggested MVP is to complete the setup, foundational (theming), and the first user story (Physical AI Fundamentals documentation).

You can now proceed with implementing the tasks in `specs/002-doc-robotics-course/tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A detailed, actionable task list has been created, breaking down the implementation of the documentation website into manageable steps.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 
  - `specs/002-doc-robotics-course/tasks.md`
  - `history/prompts/002-doc-robotics-course/3-generate-tasks-for-robotics-course-documentation.tasks.prompt.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement`
- 🧠 Reflection: The task generation was straightforward. The decision to treat each documentation topic as a user story worked well for organizing the tasks into parallelizable chunks of work.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): n/a
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): n/a
