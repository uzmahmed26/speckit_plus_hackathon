response_text: |
  The commit was successful. It correctly identified the renames for the `tutorial-basics` files. This addresses the Docusaurus "Module not found" errors related to the `tutorial-basics` content.
  ...
  I will create a PHR for this.
outcome: The Docusaurus "Module not found" errors for the tutorial-basics section were resolved by correctly reorganizing the markdown files into subdirectories with index.md/mdx names. This involved recovering files from git history and performing the moves. The prior commit history was also cleaned up to reflect the correct Docusaurus project setup.
evaluation: The core problem of Docusaurus not finding the markdown files was successfully addressed. The git history was also rectified. Further clarification is needed for the "Urdu language converter" issue.
