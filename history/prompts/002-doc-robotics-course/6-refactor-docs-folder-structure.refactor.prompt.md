  I have completed all the requested file reorganizations.
  ...
  I will now create the PHR for this interaction.
outcome: The docs folder structure was reorganized as requested. A prior uncommitted Docusaurus setup was identified and committed first, followed by the reorganization changes. The .gemini/settings.json and .gitignore files were added to .gitignore to prevent future tracking. The "Urdu language converter" issue requires further clarification from the user.
evaluation: The task was successfully completed, but required an extra step to identify and commit previously untracked Docusaurus project files.
