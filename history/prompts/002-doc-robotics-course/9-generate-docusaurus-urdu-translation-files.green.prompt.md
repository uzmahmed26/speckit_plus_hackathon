  Success! The `npm run write-translations` command executed successfully this time, without any YAML parsing errors.
  ...
  I will commit the change to `frontend/docs/simulation/platforms/index.md` and then create a PHR for this interaction.
outcome: Resolved all Docusaurus YAML parsing errors by enclosing title values in double quotes, which allowed the successful generation of Urdu translation files using `npm run write-translations -- --locale ur`. The structure for Urdu content is now created, enabling manual translation.
evaluation: Successfully set up the necessary infrastructure for Docusaurus language switching. The remaining task of content translation is now manual for the user.
