## Prompt

/sp.plan

## Response snapshot

The planning phase for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course Documentation" is complete. The implementation plan and all associated artifacts have been generated.

**Branch**: `002-doc-robotics-course`
**Implementation Plan**: `specs/002-doc-robotics-course/plan.md`

**Generated Artifacts**:
- `specs/002-doc-robotics-course/research.md`
- `specs/002-doc-robotics-course/data-model.md`
- `specs/002-doc-robotics-course/contracts/routes.md`
- `specs/002-doc-robotics-course/quickstart.md`

The agent context has been updated. You can now proceed with generating the tasks for this feature by running `/sp.tasks`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The implementation plan was successfully created, defining the technical approach, project structure, and research findings.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 
  - `specs/002-doc-robotics-course/plan.md`
  - `specs/002-doc-robotics-course/research.md`
  - `specs/002-doc-robotics-course/data-model.md`
  - `specs/002-doc-robotics-course/contracts/routes.md`
  - `specs/002-doc-robotics-course/quickstart.md`
  - `history/prompts/002-doc-robotics-course/2-plan-robotics-course-documentation.plan.prompt.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.tasks`
- 🧠 Reflection: The research phase was extensive and required multiple search queries to gather enough information. The process of appending to the research file was error-prone and required multiple attempts to get right. A better approach would be to construct the full file content in memory before writing to the file once.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Repeatedly overwriting a file instead of appending to it.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): n/a
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): When updating a file, read the entire content, modify it in memory, and then write the entire new content back to the file.
