response_text: |
  I have modified `src/components/HomepageFeatures/styles.module.css` to reduce the size of the cards. I have adjusted padding, font sizes, icon sizes, and margins to make the cards and their content smaller. I also adjusted the responsive styles to ensure the cards look good on smaller screens.
