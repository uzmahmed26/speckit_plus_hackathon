# API Contracts: Backend Setup and Refactoring

**Date**: 2025-11-28
**Feature**: `specs/003-backend-setup`

This feature is a refactoring of an existing application and does not introduce any new API endpoints or modify existing API contracts. The work involves removing internal components, which should not affect the external-facing API, other than removing any routes that were specific to the deleted features.
